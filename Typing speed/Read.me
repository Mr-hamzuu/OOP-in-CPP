# ⌨️ Typing Speed Test (C++)

This project is a console-based **Typing Speed Test** built with C++. It challenges users to improve their typing speed and accuracy by displaying random sentences from a binary file, timing their input, and then evaluating their performance.

Users can choose from different difficulty levels—Easy, Medium, and Hard—each offering sentences of increasing complexity. After typing the displayed sentence, the program calculates:

- 📈 **Typing Speed** (characters per minute)
- ✅ **Accuracy** (percentage of correct characters)
- 🔤 **Total Characters and Words Typed**
- ❌ **Number of Mistakes**

---

## 💡 Features

- 🎯 Difficulty modes (Easy, Medium, Hard)
- 📁 Binary file handling for sentence storage
- 🎰 Random sentence selection
- ⏱ Real-time timing with `time.h`
- 📊 Performance report including speed, accuracy, and mistakes
- 🎨 ANSI color-coded terminal output

---

## 📦 How It Works

1. The user selects a difficulty level from the menu.
2. A random sentence is read from a `.bin` file containing fixed-size sentence blocks.
3. The sentence is displayed, and the timer starts.
4. The user types the sentence and presses Enter.
5. The program calculates and displays the result.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- C++ (OOP with classes and inheritance)
- File I/O (Binary mode)
- ANSI Escape Codes (for color output)
- `ctime` (for timing)
- `cstring` and `iomanip`

## 🧪 Usage

```bash
g++ main.cpp -o typing_test
./typing_test
